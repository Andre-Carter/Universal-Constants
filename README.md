# Universal-Constants

Source: https://pml.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/Table/allascii.txt

- All physical constants are included (I'm yet to hard audit values if any typos)
- Access to name, value, units, and uncertainty 

- Alphabetically listed exactly as source (A-Z)
- Naming is exactly as listed from our source (which includes capitalization, abbreviations, etc)
- Numbering format follows a strict underscore separation every 3 numbers starting from the decimal placement to promote readability
- Trailing zeros are excluded
- Integers have a required zero due to all numerical values being of the f64 (64 bit floating point) type
